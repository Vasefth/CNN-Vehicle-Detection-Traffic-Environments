# CNN-Vehicle-Detection-Traffic-Environments

This repository contains the code for the thesis and forthcoming paper, *"CNN-based Object Detection for Autonomous Driving: A Comparative Analysis."* The project explores the application of various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures—Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and VGG16—for vehicle detection in traffic environments. Each model is evaluated based on metrics such as precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP) under diverse conditions.

## Overview

Autonomous driving relies heavily on accurate object detection systems to ensure safe navigation. This project implements and compares three CNN architectures widely used in object detection tasks:

- **Faster R-CNN**: Known for its high precision and ability to localize objects accurately in complex environments.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Optimized for real-time object detection with a single evaluation of the image, prioritizing speed.
- **VGG16**: Originally designed for image classification, VGG16 was adapted for object detection to evaluate its performance relative to more specialized models.

These models were trained and tested on a vehicle detection dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/car-object-detection), providing a robust evaluation of their performance in realistic traffic scenarios.

## Architectures

The repository is organized into three main directories corresponding to the CNN architectures:

- **Faster R-CNN**: A two-stage detector that generates region proposals and refines them for accurate object localization.
- **YOLO**: A single-stage detector designed for real-time detection, with versions YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 included.
- **VGG16**: Adapted for object detection, though primarily focused on feature extraction, with results serving as a comparative baseline.

Each directory contains a dedicated README file detailing the specific code, configuration, and setup instructions for training and evaluating that architecture.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the [Car Object Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/car-object-detection) dataset from Kaggle, which includes annotated images of vehicles in various traffic environments. The annotations include bounding boxes for vehicles, which are used for training the detection models.

### Data Preparation

- The dataset is split into training and validation sets.
- Bounding box annotations are normalized to fit each model's specific requirements (e.g., YOLO format for YOLO models).
- The images are preprocessed for input into the CNNs, with the appropriate augmentations applied.

## Evaluation Metrics

Each architecture is evaluated on:

- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified by the model.
- **mAP (mean Average Precision)**: A key metric in object detection, which averages the precision across multiple recall thresholds to assess overall performance.

## Results

The results from this comparative analysis highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model in terms of speed, accuracy, and robustness in real-world traffic scenarios. YOLO models tend to perform well in real-time applications, while Faster R-CNN offers superior precision at the cost of inference speed. VGG16, despite its limitations in object detection, provided insights into the trade-offs between specialized and general-purpose CNNs.

## Usage

To replicate the experiments, follow the instructions in the individual architecture directories. Each directory contains a script for training, validation, and inference using the provided dataset.

```bash
# Install YOLO
pip install ultralytics

# Run training (example for YOLOv5)
python yolov5/train.py --data dataset.yaml --epochs 100
```

Additional instructions and configurations for Faster R-CNN and VGG16 can be found in their respective directories.

## Future Work

The project serves as a foundation for further research into improving object detection models for autonomous driving. Future enhancements may include:

- Experimenting with additional architectures.
- Extending the models to work with video streams for real-time detection.
- Optimizing the models for deployment on edge devices in real-world autonomous driving systems.
